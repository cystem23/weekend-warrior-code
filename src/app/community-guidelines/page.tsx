            Become familiar with the Emergency Call Boxes (ECBs) located around campus.
            ECBs can be identified by a blue light mounted above the box.

            Program the number for UHM DPS into your phone: (808) 956-6911. If you see something out of the ordinary,
            call us!
          </li>
          <li>
            Avoid situations that put you at greater risk (such as walking alone after dark or in high crime areas
            around the city).
          </li>
          <li>
            If you are being harassed, loudly say “Leave me alone!” If that doesn&apos;t stop the harassment,
            continue to attract people&apos;s attention and head towards a store or other populated area.
          </li>
          <li>
            Be aware of your surroundings while walking/jogging alone. If using headphones,
            always leave one earbud out so that you can stay alert.
          </li>
          <li>
            When you go to social gatherings, go with a group of friends. Arrive together,
            check in with each other throughout the evening, and leave together.
          </li>
          <li>
            Do not accept drinks (alcoholic or non-alcoholic) from strangers.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you see anything unusual or suspicious, notify UHM Department of Public Safety.
            Do not physically engage suspects involved in criminal activity. Stay at a safe distance,
            note the suspect&apos;s description, and seek help as soon as possible.
